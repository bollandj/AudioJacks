# Licence

I have attached an MIT licence, it is free to use and modify for any use. I don't beleive in licences as they are only useful for the super wealthy who can afford gambling on litigation and the only people that really win are the Lawyers. Hopefully it will help if you need the proof that I won't come after you.
